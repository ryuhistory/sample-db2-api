# Sample Db2 API

Sample API which exposes Db2 native RESTful services as an OpenAPI 3.0 defined REST API.

## Structure

The `start` directory contains an initial project layout which can be used as the basis of learning the process of creating an API in the z/OS Connect Designer container. The `finish` directory contains a completed API which can be used to see all the parts and definitions of a completed API.

## Using the samples

Follow the instructions in the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-connect/3.0.0?topic=project-creating-db2-zos-connect-api) on how to use these examples.
